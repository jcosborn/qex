##  \brief The bitmap API, for use in hwloc itself.
##

## * \defgroup hwlocality_bitmap The bitmap API
##
##  The ::hwloc_bitmap_t type represents a set of integers (positive or null).
##  A bitmap may be of infinite size (all bits are set after some point).
##  A bitmap may even be full if all bits are set.
##
##  Bitmaps are used by hwloc for sets of OS processors
##  (which may actually be hardware threads) as by ::hwloc_cpuset_t
##  (a typedef for ::hwloc_bitmap_t), or sets of NUMA memory nodes
##  as ::hwloc_nodeset_t (also a typedef for ::hwloc_bitmap_t).
##  Those are used for cpuset and nodeset fields in the ::hwloc_obj structure,
##  see \ref hwlocality_object_sets.
##
##  <em>Both CPU and node sets are always indexed by OS physical number.</em>
##  However users should usually not build CPU and node sets manually
##  (e.g. with hwloc_bitmap_set()).
##  One should rather use existing object sets and combine them with
##  hwloc_bitmap_or(), etc.
##  For instance, binding the current thread on a pair of cores may be performed with:
##  \code
##  hwloc_obj_t core1 = ... , core2 = ... ;
##  hwloc_bitmap_t set = hwloc_bitmap_alloc();
##  hwloc_bitmap_or(set, core1->cpuset, core2->cpuset);
##  hwloc_set_cpubind(topology, set, HWLOC_CPUBIND_THREAD);
##  hwloc_bitmap_free(set);
##  \endcode
##
##  \note Most functions below return an int that may be negative in case of
##  error. The usual error case would be an internal failure to realloc/extend
##  the storage of the bitmap (\p errno would be set to \c ENOMEM).
##
##  \note Several examples of using the bitmap API are available under the
##  doc/examples/ directory in the source tree.
##  Regression tests such as tests/hwloc/hwloc_bitmap*.c also make intensive use
##  of this API.

##  constant descrptions here in this file.
##
##  Hwloc has wonderful documentation in both PDF and HTML formats for
##  your reading pleasure.  The formal documentation explains a LOT of
##  hwloc-specific concepts, provides definitions, and discusses the
##  "big picture" for many of the things that you'll find here in this
##  header file.
##
##  The PDF/HTML documentation was generated via Doxygen; much of what
##  you'll see in there is also here in this file.  BUT THERE IS A LOT
##  THAT IS IN THE PDF/HTML THAT IS ***NOT*** IN hwloc.h!
##
##  There are entire paragraph-length descriptions, discussions, and
##  pretty prictures to explain subtle corner cases, provide concrete
##  examples, etc.
##
##  Please, go read the documentation.  :-)
##
##  Moreover there are several examples of hwloc use under doc/examples

##
##  Hwloc uses bitmaps to represent two distinct kinds of object sets:
##  CPU sets (::hwloc_cpuset_t) and NUMA node sets (::hwloc_nodeset_t).
##  These types are both typedefs to a common back end type
##  (::hwloc_bitmap_t), and therefore all the hwloc bitmap functions
##  are applicable to both ::hwloc_cpuset_t and ::hwloc_nodeset_t (see
##  \ref hwlocality_bitmap).
##
##  The rationale for having two different types is that even though
##  the actions one wants to perform on these types are the same (e.g.,
##  enable and disable individual items in the set/mask), they're used
##  in very different contexts: one for specifying which processors to
##  use and one for specifying which NUMA nodes to use.  Hence, the
##  name difference is really just to reflect the intent of where the
##  type is used.

## * \defgroup hwlocality_cpubinding CPU binding
##
##  Some operating systems only support binding threads or processes to a single PU.
##  Others allow binding to larger sets such as entire Cores or Packages or
##  even random sets of invididual PUs. In such operating system, the scheduler
##  is free to run the task on one of these PU, then migrate it to another PU, etc.
##  It is often useful to call hwloc_bitmap_singlify() on the target CPU set before
##  passing it to the binding function to avoid these expensive migrations.
##  See the documentation of hwloc_bitmap_singlify() for details.
##
##  Some operating systems do not provide all hwloc-supported
##  mechanisms to bind processes, threads, etc.
##  hwloc_topology_get_support() may be used to query about the actual CPU
##  binding support in the currently used operating system.
##
##  When the requested binding operation is not available and the
##  ::HWLOC_CPUBIND_STRICT flag was passed, the function returns -1.
##  \p errno is set to \c ENOSYS when it is not possible to bind the requested kind of object
##  processes/threads. errno is set to \c EXDEV when the requested cpuset
##  can not be enforced (e.g. some systems only allow one CPU, and some
##  other systems only allow one NUMA node).
##
##  If ::HWLOC_CPUBIND_STRICT was not passed, the function may fail as well,
##  or the operating system may use a slightly different operation
##  (with side-effects, smaller binding set, etc.)
##  when the requested operation is not exactly supported.
##
##  The most portable version that should be preferred over the others,
##  whenever possible, is the following one which just binds the current program,
##  assuming it is single-threaded:
##
##  \code
##  hwloc_set_cpubind(topology, set, 0),
##  \endcode
##
##  If the program may be multithreaded, the following one should be preferred
##  to only bind the current thread:
##
##  \code
##  hwloc_set_cpubind(topology, set, HWLOC_CPUBIND_THREAD),
##  \endcode
##
##  \sa Some example codes are available under doc/examples/ in the source tree.
##
##  \note To unbind, just call the binding function with either a full cpuset or
##  a cpuset equal to the system cpuset.
##
##  \note On some operating systems, CPU binding may have effects on memory binding, see
##  ::HWLOC_CPUBIND_NOMEMBIND

## * \defgroup hwlocality_membinding Memory binding
##
##  Memory binding can be done three ways:
##
##  - explicit memory allocation thanks to hwloc_alloc_membind() and friends:
##    the binding will have effect on the memory allocated by these functions.
##  - implicit memory binding through binding policy: hwloc_set_membind() and
##    friends only define the current policy of the process, which will be
##    applied to the subsequent calls to malloc() and friends.
##  - migration of existing memory ranges, thanks to hwloc_set_area_membind()
##    and friends, which move already-allocated data.
##
##  Not all operating systems support all three ways.
##  hwloc_topology_get_support() may be used to query about the actual memory
##  binding support in the currently used operating system.
##
##  When the requested binding operation is not available and the
##  ::HWLOC_MEMBIND_STRICT flag was passed, the function returns -1.
##  \p errno will be set to \c ENOSYS when the system does support
##  the specified action or policy
##  (e.g., some systems only allow binding memory on a per-thread
##  basis, whereas other systems only allow binding memory for all
##  threads in a process).
##  \p errno will be set to EXDEV when the requested set can not be enforced
##  (e.g., some systems only allow binding memory to a single NUMA node).
##
##  If ::HWLOC_MEMBIND_STRICT was not passed, the function may fail as well,
##  or the operating system may use a slightly different operation
##  (with side-effects, smaller binding set, etc.)
##  when the requested operation is not exactly supported.
##
##  The most portable form that should be preferred over the others
##  whenever possible is as follows.
##  It allocates some memory hopefully bound to the specified set.
##  To do so, hwloc will possibly have to change the current memory
##  binding policy in order to actually get the memory bound, if the OS
##  does not provide any other way to simply allocate bound memory
##  without changing the policy for all allocations. That is the
##  difference with hwloc_alloc_membind(), which will never change the
##  current memory binding policy.
##
##  \code
##  hwloc_alloc_membind_policy(topology, size, set,
##                             HWLOC_MEMBIND_BIND, 0);
##  \endcode
##
##  Each hwloc memory binding function takes a bitmap argument that
##  is a CPU set by default, or a NUMA memory node set if the flag
##  ::HWLOC_MEMBIND_BYNODESET is specified.
##  See \ref hwlocality_object_sets and \ref hwlocality_bitmap for a
##  discussion of CPU sets and NUMA memory node sets.
##  It is also possible to convert between CPU set and node set using
##  hwloc_cpuset_to_nodeset() or hwloc_cpuset_from_nodeset().
##
##  Memory binding by CPU set cannot work for CPU-less NUMA memory nodes.
##  Binding by nodeset should therefore be preferred whenever possible.

##  \note If ::HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_INCLUDE_DISALLOWED was set, applying
##  hwloc_bitmap_intersects() on the result of this function and on an object
##  nodeset checks whether there are allowed NUMA nodes inside that object.
##  Applying hwloc_bitmap_and() returns the list of these allowed NUMA nodes.
##
##  \note The returned nodeset is not newly allocated and should thus not be
##  changed or freed, hwloc_bitmap_dup() must be used to obtain a local copy.
